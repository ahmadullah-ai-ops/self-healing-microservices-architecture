# Self-Healing Microservices Architecture

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a self-healing microservices system that can detect failures and automatically recover without human intervention. The system uses containerized microservices (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) along with AI-driven observability and recovery mechanisms.

### Key Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each service is isolated in a container, allowing for independent scaling and failure recovery.
- **AI-Driven Monitoring**: AI-based monitoring tools continuously check the health of each microservice, detecting abnormal behavior or resource consumption.
- **Automatic Recovery**: Upon detecting failures, the system uses Kubernetes auto-restarts and load balancers to redistribute traffic and restart services.
- **Autonomous Decisions**: An AI decision engine determines when to restart, shut down, or scale microservices based on performance metrics.
- **Continuous Feedback Loop**: The AI learns from system behavior and continuously adjusts thresholds for failure detection, improving its decision-making over time.

## Self-Healing Architecture
1. **Architecture Setup**:  
   Each microservice is deployed in its own container (Docker) and orchestrated with Kubernetes, ensuring isolation. This setup allows for individual scaling, restarting, and recovery of services.

2. **AI-Powered Monitoring**:  
   AI-based observability tools (e.g., Instana, New Relic) monitor the health of each service by analyzing resource usage, response times, and error logs. The AI system detects anomalies that may indicate a potential failure.

3. **Recovery Automation**:  
   Once the monitoring system detects a failure or abnormality, predefined recovery mechanisms are triggered, such as restarting services, redirecting traffic, or scaling up resources.

4. **Autonomous Decision Engine**:  
   A reinforcement learning-based engine is integrated into the system. It learns from system metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory, network traffic) and automatically makes decisions to shut down or restart services when necessary.

5. **Continuous Feedback Loop**:  
   The AI system dynamically adjusts the failure detection threshold based on real-time performance data, allowing for a continuous feedback loop that refines the recovery process over time.

## Project Files
- **microservices/**:  
  Contains the Docker files and source code for the individual microservices (`service_a` and `service_b`). These services communicate with each other and can simulate failure scenarios.
- **src/**:  
  Contains the Python scripts for monitoring, recovery, and decision-making:
  - **monitoring.py**: Implements AI-powered monitoring of microservices.
  - **recovery.py**: Defines the logic for restarting and scaling services based on monitoring alerts.
  - **decision_engine.py**: Implements the autonomous decision engine to make intelligent recovery decisions.
  
## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-healing-microservices-architecture.git
    ```
2. **Build the microservices**:
    ```bash
    cd microservices/service_a
    docker build -t service_a .
    cd ../service_b
    docker build -t service_b .
    ```
3. **Deploy on Kubernetes** (or use Docker Compose if Kubernetes isn't available).
4. **Run AI Monitoring**:
    ```bash
    python src/monitoring.py
    ```
